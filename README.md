# Bachelor's Thesis Project – Interactive Notebooks for Teaching Neural Networks

As part of my Bachelor's thesis, I developed two interactive Jupyter notebooks designed to introduce advanced high school students to key concepts in neural networks. These materials were intended for students participating in a school-work alternation program at the University of Turin.

📁 notebooks/: Contains the two educational Jupyter notebooks that guide students through hands-on examples and explanations of neural network fundamentals.

📁 presentation/: Includes the presentation used to illustrate the project to the thesis commission.

📁 presentation/theory/: Provides a supplemental presentation explaining the physical phenomenon behind the dataset used in the notebooks — b-tagging, a method used in particle physics to identify jets originating from b-quarks.

This project combined educational design, scientific communication, and technical implementation to make complex machine learning topics accessible to younger students.
